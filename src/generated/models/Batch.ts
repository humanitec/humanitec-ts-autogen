 * Humanitec API
 * # Introduction The *Humanitec API* allows you to automate and integrate Humanitec into your developer and operational workflows. The API is a REST based API. It is based around a set of concepts:  * Core * External Resources * Sets and Deltas  ## Authentication  Almost all requests made to the Humanitec API require Authentication. See our [Developer Docs on API Authentication](https://developer.humanitec.com/platform-orchestrator/reference/api-references/#authentication) for instructions.  ## Content Types The Humanitec API, unless explicitly specified, only accepts content types of `application/json` and will always return valid `application/json` or an empty response.  ## Response Codes ### Success Any response code in the `2xx` range should be regarded as success.  | **Code** | **Meaning**                         | |----------|-------------------------------------| | `200`    | Success                             | | `201`    | Success, a new resource was created | | `204`    | Success, but no content in response |  _Note: We plan to simplify the interface by replacing 201 with 200 status codes._  ### Failure Any response code in the `4xx` range should be regarded as an error that can be rectified by the client. `5xx` error codes indicate errors that cannot be corrected by the client.  | **Code** | **Meaning**                                                                                                           | |----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | `400`    | General error. (Body will contain details)                                                                            | | `401`    | Attempt to access protected resource without `Authorization` Header.                                                  | | `403`    | The `Bearer` or `JWT` does not grant access to the requested resource.                                                | | `404`    | Resource not found.                                                                                                   | | `405`    | Method not allowed                                                                                                    | | `409`    | Conflict. Usually indicated a resource with that ID already exists.                                                   | | `422`    | Unprocessable Entity. The body was not valid JSON, was empty or contained an object different from what was expected. | | `429`    | Too many requests - request rate limit has been reached.                                                              | | `500`    | Internal Error. If it occurs repeatedly, contact support.                                                             |
